## Signed commits

Every commit that reaches the default branch must be signed; a ruleset refuses
unsigned pushes. Estate policy:
[SIGNING-POLICY](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards/blob/main/docs/SIGNING-POLICY.adoc).

- **People and interactive agents** sign with an SSH key registered on GitHub
  as a *signing* key (`gpg.format=ssh`, `user.signingkey=<key>.pub`,
  `commit.gpgsign=true`). The committer email must be verified on that account.
- **Apps, bots and workflows** never `git push` local commits. They write
  through the API (`createCommitOnBranch` or the estate `signed-push` action)
  so that GitHub signs each commit.
- Merge PRs with **squash**. The ruleset checks every commit on the PR branch,
  not just the result, so one unsigned commit blocks the merge. Re-create such a
  branch with signed commits (`git cherry-pick -S`) and open a new PR.
  Rebase-merge replays commits unsigned and is disabled.
